On différencie pour que les données soient "stationary".
Pourquoi est-ce important?

Stationarity is important because non-stationary time series data can lead to unreliable and spurious regression results. Specifically:

Spurious Relationships: Non-stationary data may exhibit trends or patterns over time that can cause two unrelated variables to appear correlated.
Invalid Statistical Inferences: Standard statistical tests assume stationarity. Using non-stationary data violates these assumptions, leading to invalid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.
Predictive Stability: Stationary data ensures that the underlying properties of the time series do not change over time, making models built on past data more reliable for future predictions.
Differencing the data to achieve stationarity stabilizes the mean and variance, allowing for valid regression analysis and meaningful interpretation of the results.
