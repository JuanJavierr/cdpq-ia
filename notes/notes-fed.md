The FED does not directly control interest rates, but sets a target and has tools to fix an upper and lower range for that target.
The tool for the upper range is the **Federal Funds Rate (FFR)**: The interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow money overnight.
The tool for the lower range is the **Overnight Reserve Repurchases (ON RRP)**: Securities, like treasury bills, that the FED lends to banks, usually for a day, while paying interest.

"It can take as long as two years to se the full results from interest rate changes."
"Financial industry tends to benefit from interest rate hikes."

They meet every 6 weeks.
